# Covid-19 Pandemic 2019-2020
I have developed this website for people who are interested to see data related to 2019-2020 Covid-19 pandemic.  This website offers the following:
•	Up to date, coronavirus cases data from all over the World.
•	Dynamically updated details for selected country cases with its flag.
•	Coivd-19 graph displaying percentage of cases in selected country.
•	Information about corona virus symptoms with useful links
•	Information and instructions related to COVID-19.
•	Fully functional form if anyone wants to contact back.
# UX
The website is designed with a modern look, it’s a simple an elegant design easy to navigate and follow. This website is designed and built considering following potential users who might like to use this website.
•	Someone who wants to view how countries are affected by COVID-19
•	Someone who wants to see how many percentages of people are affected by Pandemic
•	Someone who is looking what are COVID-19 symptoms
•	Someone looking for instructions in general “how to keep safe”
•	Old people looking for symptoms and instructions “how to keep safe”
•	Pregnant women who are looking for instructions and information “how to keep safe” 
•	Families with children who are looking for COVID-19 information and instructions.
The aim of this website is to provide statistical data with concise information and useful link. Before starting this project, I was regularly looking for similar set of information. My family is in Pakistan and I was looking COVID related information in Pakistan. Assuming there are other people like me who might want visit website for similar reasons.

## Features Left to Implement
In future I am planning to update coding behind website with more object-oriented approach.
I want to update project with effective animations.
I want to update web with user can get COVID data for selected date
There are few flag and country name errors. I didn’t manage to find flags.svg file and also country names coming out from API are not correct I have requested Rapid API to correct them.  
There is a fault in API data it always showing UK recovered cases to 0. I have requested Rapid API to correct this issue. Once issue is corrected Web is automatically going to show correct data.

# Testing
The Website was tested in different browsers at each stage of its development, for example Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari. Website forms and other content is also tested on machines with slower processor power and internet speed which is comparatively a lot slower than normal broadband speeds. Website is also tested on different mobile devices on both horizontal and vertical screen rotation.
During testing face I dealt with following problems.
Email JS was only working when I was sending using my yahoo email address, which I was also used to make my Email JS account. I notices this problem in testing phase and I have resolved it. I think there is some compatibility issue with Email JS and yahoo, Once I started using G-mail forms started working efficiently. 
In testing phase I realised some of countries flag have white part which on white background was not visible. In finalising phase of project, I noticed at and implement grey background colour to flag.
